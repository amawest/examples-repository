1,Bahram Gur in the Yellow Pavilion,"This text describes an episode from the Haft Paykar (Seven thrones) of Niẓāmī Ganjavī (died 1202−3), the fourth book from his Khamsah (Quintet). In this romantic allegory of love and frustration, Sassanian ruler Bahram Gur (died 438) visits seven pavilions on each day of the week. Here, Niẓāmī describes the ruler's visit to the gunbad-i zar (yellow pavilion) on a Ruz-i yakshamba (Sunday), an anecdote represented on the folio's verso. In this tale, Bahram Gur is disappointed by his concubines and convinces a woman, who first refuses his advances, to marry him. The ruler is shown seated in the upper left, surrounded by women offering food and playing musical instruments. The yellow dome of the pavilion breaks through the top margin, and a number of verses describing the events frame the painting at the top and bottom. The verses are executed in black nasta'liq script in four columns separated by gold gutters. Four verses in the paper's center are written diagonally, providing a clue to the end of one section, as well as the beginning of the subsequent tale of the yellow pavilion (whose title appears in the illuminated chapter heading in the bottom center). This text page and the painting on the folio's verso are typical of Persian illustrated manuscripts of Niẓāmī's Khamsah produced during the Safavid period. A great number of such works were made in 16th-century Shiraz, southwestern Persia (present-day Iran), for export to Ottoman Turkey and Mughal India.

2,"Bahram Gur Hunting from Nizami’s ""Khamsah""","This painting represents an episode drawn from Nizami Ganjavi’s Haft Paykar (Seven thrones), the fourth book of his Khamsah (Quintet). The great Sasanian king Bahram Gur (reigned 430‒38), famous for his hunting prowess and thus known by his nickname (Bahram Gur means “wild ass”), astonishes his companions with his quasi-divine skill and power in hunting onagers. After his expedition and as a gesture of generosity, he orders 1,200 onagers (half to be branded and half to be earmarked with gold rings) to be distributed among his people. The scene shows the ruler and his entourage on horseback against a pink and green landscape as they shoot wild animals with arrows. Behind a hillock appear four other men either looking at the scene below or observing the birds flying in the gold-painted sky. Above and below the painting are illuminated panels of the story’s text, which continues on the fragment’s verso. The illuminated panels with diagonal text and triangular corners, or “thumb pieces,” in the upper-right corner create a visual marker for the painting. The painting is typical of 16th-century Persian compositions, but it was repaired and repainted at a later date. A large rectangular panel was added, and missing areas of the painting were filled. Some of the characters’ faces also bear overpainting. The collections of the Library of Congress contain several other paintings illustrating this and other episodes from Nizami’s Khamsah.",Niẓāmī Ganjavī,1500 - 1599,Persian,Iran,Library of Congress,manuscript,https://www.wdl.org/en/item/3137/#q=shahnamah&qla=en,https://www.wdl.org/en/item/6954/manifest
3,"The Div Akvan throws Rustam into the Sea from Firdawsi's ""Shahnamah"" ","This painting represents an episode described in the Shahnamah (The book of kings), the epic story of ancient kings and heroes of Persia composed by the renowned poet Firdawsi during the first decades of the 11th century. The text on the fragment’s recto and verso describes the painting. King Khusraw summons Rustam to help him stop a div (demon) disguised as a wild ass that is ravaging the royal herds. After three days of unsuccessful battle, the hero falls asleep in the grass. Thereupon, the Div Akvan casts aside his disguise, resumes his demonic form, rushes towards Rustam, and digs up the ground around the hero. He gives Rustam the choice of being thrown against the mountains, to be eaten by lions and onagers, or cast into the sea, where he would drown. Knowing that the demon’s action would be the exact opposite to his request and realizing that, if cast into the sea, he would have a chance to swim to safety, he asks to be thrown against the mountains. Rustam is then cast into the sea, swims back to the shore, and returns to defeat the demon in combat. The painting shows the precise moment when the Div Akvan pauses before deciding to hurl Rustam into the waters. The demon stands tall, his outstretched arms supporting a still-sleeping Rustam, as his gold bell bangles clang loudly. A posteriori labels added to the right of Rustam’s head and at the demon’s waist identify Rustam and Div Akvan. On the right side of the composition, rocky mountains and two threatening tigers are depicted, while, at the bottom of the painting, a variety of fish swim in the sea. Immediately above the painting, the chapter heading executed in gold ink identifies the scene and its corresponding text. The painting's style and composition are typical of illustrated manuscripts of the Shahnamah produced during the Safavid period in Iran. The shapes of the rocky outcrop, loosely painted in light-blue, pink, and yellow washes, seem to hint at facial features. The layout of the text and the script (nastaʻliq) as visible on the painting's verso also are characteristic of 16th-century Persian manuscripts. The lower-right corner of the painting has suffered damage and thus a small portion of the painting is lost to us today.

4,"The Battle of Mazandaran from ""Hamzahnamah""","This large-scale painting depicts the Battle of Mazandaran, an event in the Persian romance of the mythical adventures and battles of Amir Hamzah, the uncle of the Prophet Muhammad, recorded in the famous Hamzahnamah (Book of Hamzah). The Hamzahnamah was begun around 1564 under the sponsorship of the Mughal emperor Akbar (ruled 1556‒1605) and was completed in approximately 15 years. This painting is number 38 in the seventh volume of the Hamzahnamah, as inscribed between the legs of the man in the bottom center. It depicts a battle scene in which the protagonists Khwajah ʻUmar and Hamzah, nicknamed Sahib Qiran (Owner of the Epochs), and their armies engage in a fierce battle. Originally, the faces were depicted, subsequently erased by iconoclasts, and repainted in more recent times. Only the face of the groom wearing an orange turban in the center of the left edge has been left untouched. Immediately above this figure, a soldier in a studded gold tunic has a disjointed face, revealing how an old border was removed and faces retouched. Approximately 50 painters worked on the project under the supervision of the famous artists Mir Sayyid ʻAli and ʻAbd al-Samad, who both had worked circa 1522‒35 on the royal Shahnamah of the Safavid ruler Shah Tahmasp. Although a number of the paintings are linked to specific artists, this particular one does not bear an attribution mark. The large-scale text panel on the verso describes the Battle of Mazandaran. The text is executed in black nastaʻliq script on a large beige sheet of paper that bears substantial water damage. The last three lines also exhibit the crowded writing that is seen frequently in the manuscript as the scribe or scribes struggled to fit the complete the narrative account on each text page.","Abd al-Samad, Mīr Saiyid ʿAlī",550-620,Persian,Central and South Asia,Library of Congress,manuscript,https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7012/#q=shahnamah&qla=en,https://www.wdl.org/en/item/7012/iiif/manifest.json
