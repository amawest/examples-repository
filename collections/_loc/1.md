pid: '1'
title: Bahram Gur in the Yellow Pavilion
description: 'This text describes an episode from the Haft Paykar (Seven thrones)
  of Niẓāmī Ganjavī (died 1202−3), the fourth book from his Khamsah (Quintet). In
  this romantic allegory of love and frustration, Sassanian ruler Bahram Gur (died
  438) visits seven pavilions on each day of the week. Here, Niẓāmī describes the
  ruler''s visit to the gunbad-i zar (yellow pavilion) on a Ruz-i yakshamba (Sunday),
  an anecdote represented on the folio''s verso. In this tale, Bahram Gur is disappointed
  by his concubines and convinces a woman, who first refuses his advances, to marry
  him. The ruler is shown seated in the upper left, surrounded by women offering food
  and playing musical instruments. The yellow dome of the pavilion breaks through
  the top margin, and a number of verses describing the events frame the painting
  at the top and bottom. The verses are executed in black nasta''liq script in four
  columns separated by gold gutters. Four verses in the paper''s center are written
  diagonally, providing a clue to the end of one section, as well as the beginning
  of the subsequent tale of the yellow pavilion (whose title appears in the illuminated
  chapter heading in the bottom center). This text page and the painting on the folio''s
  verso are typical of Persian illustrated manuscripts of Niẓāmī''s Khamsah produced
  during the Safavid period. A great number of such works were made in 16th-century
  Shiraz, southwestern Persia (present-day Iran), for export to Ottoman Turkey and
  Mughal India. '
