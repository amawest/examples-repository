title: Bahram Gur Hunting from Nizami’s "Khamsah"
description: This painting represents an episode drawn from Nizami Ganjavi’s Haft
  Paykar (Seven thrones), the fourth book of his Khamsah (Quintet). The great Sasanian
  king Bahram Gur (reigned 430‒38), famous for his hunting prowess and thus known
  by his nickname (Bahram Gur means “wild ass”), astonishes his companions with his
  quasi-divine skill and power in hunting onagers. After his expedition and as a gesture
  of generosity, he orders 1,200 onagers (half to be branded and half to be earmarked
  with gold rings) to be distributed among his people. The scene shows the ruler and
  his entourage on horseback against a pink and green landscape as they shoot wild
  animals with arrows. Behind a hillock appear four other men either looking at the
  scene below or observing the birds flying in the gold-painted sky. Above and below
  the painting are illuminated panels of the story’s text, which continues on the
  fragment’s verso. The illuminated panels with diagonal text and triangular corners,
  or “thumb pieces,” in the upper-right corner create a visual marker for the painting.
  The painting is typical of 16th-century Persian compositions, but it was repaired
  and repainted at a later date. A large rectangular panel was added, and missing
  areas of the painting were filled. Some of the characters’ faces also bear overpainting.
  The collections of the Library of Congress contain several other paintings illustrating
  this and other episodes from Nizami’s Khamsah.
