title: 'The Div Akvan throws Rustam into the Sea from Firdawsi''s "Shahnamah" '
description: 'This painting represents an episode described in the Shahnamah (The
  book of kings), the epic story of ancient kings and heroes of Persia composed by
  the renowned poet Firdawsi during the first decades of the 11th century. The text
  on the fragment’s recto and verso describes the painting. King Khusraw summons Rustam
  to help him stop a div (demon) disguised as a wild ass that is ravaging the royal
  herds. After three days of unsuccessful battle, the hero falls asleep in the grass.
  Thereupon, the Div Akvan casts aside his disguise, resumes his demonic form, rushes
  towards Rustam, and digs up the ground around the hero. He gives Rustam the choice
  of being thrown against the mountains, to be eaten by lions and onagers, or cast
  into the sea, where he would drown. Knowing that the demon’s action would be the
  exact opposite to his request and realizing that, if cast into the sea, he would
  have a chance to swim to safety, he asks to be thrown against the mountains. Rustam
  is then cast into the sea, swims back to the shore, and returns to defeat the demon
  in combat. The painting shows the precise moment when the Div Akvan pauses before
  deciding to hurl Rustam into the waters. The demon stands tall, his outstretched
  arms supporting a still-sleeping Rustam, as his gold bell bangles clang loudly.
  A posteriori labels added to the right of Rustam’s head and at the demon’s waist
  identify Rustam and Div Akvan. On the right side of the composition, rocky mountains
  and two threatening tigers are depicted, while, at the bottom of the painting, a
  variety of fish swim in the sea. Immediately above the painting, the chapter heading
  executed in gold ink identifies the scene and its corresponding text. The painting''s
  style and composition are typical of illustrated manuscripts of the Shahnamah produced
  during the Safavid period in Iran. The shapes of the rocky outcrop, loosely painted
  in light-blue, pink, and yellow washes, seem to hint at facial features. The layout
  of the text and the script (nastaʻliq) as visible on the painting''s verso also
  are characteristic of 16th-century Persian manuscripts. The lower-right corner of
  the painting has suffered damage and thus a small portion of the painting is lost
  to us today. '
