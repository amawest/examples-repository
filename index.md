__Wax__ is a [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/) project for producing digital exhibitions focused on impact, durability, ease, and flexibility. Our underlying technology is made to learn and to teach, and can produce beautifully rendered, high-quality image collections and scholarly exhibits. To start using Wax, please see our [documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/) for installation instructions and more.
