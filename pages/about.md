# About

Wax is an extensible workflow for producing scholarly exhibitions with minimal computing principles. It focuses on a few key tasks for creating digital exhibitions as static sites, namely:

- Generating pages for collection items from (meta)data files
- Generating IIIF derivatives and JSON for deep-zooming viewers and interoperable image content
- Generating a search index
- Running tests to catch errors

Wax is comprised of a few Ruby gems, some customizable UI components, and a lot of documentation/recipes for use using them to create, deploy, and maintain digital exhibitions.

## Who is it for?

Wax is for individuals and groups who either don't have or don't want to use a lot of resources to create scholarly exhibitions. It's best suited for folks who are willing to take on some technical responsibility in exchange for a lot of flexibility.

At the moment, Wax has a relatively high but general-purpose learning curve. To get the most out of Wax, you should have some familiarity with:

- Using an interactive shell (e.g., Bash/Terminal) to install and interact with programs and libraries on your local machine.
- Using Git and GitHub to version control and collaborate on projects
- Using Jekyll to generate static sites.
- Creating and normalizing data files (e.g., CSVs, JSOM, YAML)
- File-naming conventions and best practices
- Writing HTML, CSS, and some JavaScript

Wax is also great for teaching the skills above.
