__Wax__ is an extensible workflow for producing scholarly exhibitions with minimal computing principles. It's comprised of:

- a few Ruby gems for processing image data and associated metadata ([wax_tasks](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_tasks/), [wax_iiif](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_iiif/)),
- a Jekyll theme ([wax_theme](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_theme/)), and 
- (hopefully soon!) a lot of documentation and recipes for creating, deploying, and maintaining digital exhibitions ([wax_docs](https://github.com/minicomp/wax_docs/)).
