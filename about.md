Wax is a modular, minimal theme for creating digital exhibitions. It leverages the power of [Jekyll](), which is a modern and easy-to-use static site generator.

When complete, Wax will include many of the components expected of database-powered platforms like WordPress, Scalar, or Omeka. These components will be discrete, lightweight, interoperable, and easy to use, creating an expansive framework of Jekyll tooling that enables scholars to dynamically assemble what they need and drop what they don’t.

Need a site with dynamic search but can’t commit to maintaining a database? Want to make a IIIF image exhibition or a D3js data visualization from student-generated CSVs? Need to host thousands of pages, but don’t have a budget for server space? These are just a few of the directions currently giving shape to Wax.

## Current Features

- Layouts for images and metadata (either IIIF or flat image)
- Masonry layout for image gallery
- Automated Markdown pages generation for our collection from CSV or YAML files
- Automated IIIF tiles and JSON data generation from local images
- Automated testing for dead links and html errors

## On the horizon

- Tag/category extraction
- Automated search index generation
- Client-side elastic search
- Automated testing on search index(es)
